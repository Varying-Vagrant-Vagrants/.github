1. Make sure your VVV is up to date, your problem might have been fixed already!
   - `vagrant status` will reveal the version you have installed 
2. Same goes for vagrant, you can check [Hashicorps vagrant install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install) for the latest version
3. Please check https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues for any existing issues
4. If not either open a new issue or you can visit our slack instance.

Note that issues are only for VVV, we are not a general Vagrant help resource. All github issues for this organisation are centralised on the main VVV repo.
